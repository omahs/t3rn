# Circuit
The Circuit is the blockchain that powers t3rn. It is the core component which handles every event and is in charge to keep the state of every on-and offchain transaction happening on t3rn. 
The Circuit is also responsible for storing Sideeffect, which will then be picket up by Executors based on [reward](sfx-overview#max_reward) set by the creator of the Sideeffect.
 


When a [Sideeffect](sfx-overview) is created, it will be stored on the Circuit.
