### Can community members participate on the tesnet? Is there an incentivized testnet?
With the Rococo launch, the team is primarily focusing on testing the first testnet release candidate of t3rn with selected integration partners. At this point the community members aren’t required to participate, but in the future they’ll be able to join as other network participants.

However, we will publish a [faucet](https://dev.net.t3rn.io/faucet/) for Testnet t0rn tokens for the community to test the network with all its current features - aka the “Play Money”.

As for the next steps, we are connecting the t3rn UI, front-end interface for  composing cross-chain execution out of  single side effects.
