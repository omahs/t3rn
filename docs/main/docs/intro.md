# Getting Started

t3rn is a smart contract hosting platform for smart contracts that have the ability to perform multichain transactions.
Developers can write their smart contracts in Solidity, !ink or languages compiling to WASM, since t3rn supports WASM and EVM.

Smart contracts are stored in the contracts registry which makes them available for everyone, so other developers can instantiate these contracts in their contracts and collaborate with them.
Creators of contracts will be [remunerated](about_t3rn/token-economics/tokenomics-inflation#gas-fees) each time someone executes it with a share of the gas fee, which opens a lot of possibilities of how the future of open source projects could look like.

To perform multichain transactions, t3rn relies on essential network components called [Executors](components/executor-overview), [Attesters](components/attester) and [Ranger](components/ranger).
